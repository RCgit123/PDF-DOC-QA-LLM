X, XX 2019 1\\nSecurity of the Internet of Things:\\nVulnerabilities, Attacks and Countermeasures\\nIsmail Butun, Member, IEEE, Patrik ¨Osterberg, Member, IEEE,\\nand Houbing Song, Senior Member, IEEE\\nAbstract —Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) constitute one of the most promising third-millennium technologies and have wide range\\nof applications in our surrounding environment. The reason behind the vast adoption of WSNs in various applications is that they have\\ntremendously appealing features, e.g., low production cost, low installation cost, unattended network operation, autonomous and\\nlongtime operation. WSNs have started to merge with the Internet of Things (IoT) through the introduction of Internet access capability\\nin sensor nodes and sensing ability in Internet-connected devices. Thereby, the IoT is providing access to huge amount of data,\\ncollected by the WSNs, over the Internet. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e. there is no dedicated\\ninfrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the ﬂowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a\\nbig concern to the scientiﬁc community. More speciﬁcally, for the application areas in which CIA (conﬁdentiality, integrity, availability)\\nhas prime importance, WSNs and emerging IoT technology might constitute an open avenue for the attackers. Besides, recent\\nintegration and collaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms of security. Hence, this would be a\\nnightmare for the individuals using these systems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks. Therefore,\\na detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along with the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those\\nattacks are provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated into mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks\\ntowards WSNs and IoT are investigated under that umbrella: “Passive Attacks” and “Active Attacks”. Understanding these attacks and\\ntheir associated defense mechanisms will help paving a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT technology.\\nIndex Terms —Cryptography, Detection, DoS, IoT, Prevention, Survey, WSN, 6LowPAN, RPL, Block-chain, TSCH, MQTT, CoAP ,\\nCoAPs, 6LowPSec, 6TiSCH.\\n!\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nRECENT developments in wireless communications and\\nMicro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technolo-\\ngies facilitated the design of Wireless Sensor Networks\\n(WSNs), in which sensor nodes collect the intelligible data\\nfrom their surrounding environments and share them in a\\nwireless fashion to send the information towards a mean-\\ningful data sink. According to scientiﬁc predictions, the total\\nnumber of wireless sensors deployed is expected to reach 60\\ntrillion at the end of the year 2022, meaning 10 thousand\\nsensors for every person on the world [1]. Therefore, all\\nthe problems and challenges concerning WSNs will expose\\nplentiful topics for the researchers.\\nOwing to their easy and cheap deployment features,\\nWSNs has wide-scale application areas in science as shown\\nin Fig. 1: To monitor environment-related events (such\\nas wildﬁre, earthquake, ocean, pollution, water quality,\\nwildlife), to collect information regarding human-related\\nactivities and observation of human behavior (such as\\n•I.

IoT market is expected to grow from more than 15\\nbillion devices in 2015 to more than 75 billion in 2025 [3].\\nThis prediction means that on average, each person on earth\\nwill have at least 25 personal IoT devices in 7 years time.\\nHenceforth, IoT is expected to have a dramatic impact on\\nour lives in near future [4]. During this period, WSNs will\\nbe integrated into IoT and innumerable sensor nodes will\\njoin the Internet aiming at cooperating with other nodes to\\nsense and monitor their environment. IoT will provide an\\ninteraction between people and environment by using the\\nWSNs more and more in near future [5].

So by following\\nthis vision, application areas of IoT will increase continu-\\nously and dramatically for every aspect of life. For example,\\nnowadays, with the diverse installation of IoT devices, we\\nare able to remotely sense and act upon situations regarding\\nour houses or ofﬁces.

Another example would be\\nfrom health-care sector (IoT applications): A recent paper\\n[8] revealed that most of the current used systems fail\\nto embed strong security services that could be preserve\\npatient privacy.

As also mentioned earlier, WSNs\\nmost probably will be integrated with IoT in the near future\\n[9]. Therefore, all cyber-security related issues, especially\\nattacks, their prevention and mitigation are very important\\nfor establishing secure and reliable IoT.\\nWSNs are vulnerable to a wide range of attack types\\nwhich might put critical threats to the security of those\\nnetworks. Therefore these attack types need to be inves-\\ntigated thoroughly. Security related attacks against WSNs\\ncan be branched into two main categories: Active attacks\\nand Passive attacks. In the passive attacks category, attackers\\nare generally hidden (camouﬂaged) and either damage the\\nfunctioning components of the network; or tap the commu-\\nnications link to collect useful information. Passive attacks\\ncan also be further categorized into eavesdropping, node\\ndestruction, node malfunctioning, node outage and trafﬁc\\nanalysis types. Whereas in the active attacks category, an\\nattacker effects the functions and operations of the targeted\\nnetwork. The result of this ill-effect can be the real objec-\\ntive of the attacker and can also be detected by security\\nmechanisms (intrusion detection). For instance, network\\nservices might be vulgarized as a consequence of this type\\nof attacks. Active attacks can also be further categorized\\ninto jamming, ﬂooding, Denial-of-Service (DoS), blackhole,\\nwormhole, sinkhole and Sybil types.In Computer Science, solutions to defend against secu-\\nrity attacks towards networks comprise of three essential\\ncomponents [2]:\\n•Prevention: This component aims at preventing at-\\ntacks before they happen. In this case, any proposed\\nmethod needs to be able to devise measures to de-\\nfend against the speciﬁc type of attack(s). Intrusion\\nprevention mechanisms can resist external attackers\\ntowards WSNs and IoT, but they are not speciﬁcally\\ndesigned to resist the internal attackers.\\n•Detection: In an event of an attack, if an adversary\\nmanages to advance the measures taken by the pre-\\nvention component, this means that defense against\\nthe attack has failed. At the moment, security solu-\\ntions that are devised for the detection component\\nof the related attack would take in-charge and work\\nat especially in identifying those nodes that are com-\\npromised. The only way of reacting against ongoing\\nattacks, especially internal attacks, is using the In-\\ntrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). After an intrusion\\nis detected, then a mitigation mechanism would be\\nissued to minimize the adverse effects of the ongoing\\nattack.\\n•Mitigation: Final component aims at mitigating at-\\ntacks after they happen, for example, in order to\\nsecure network, a security measure should be taken,\\nsuch as ‘dismissing the affected nodes in a network’\\nor ‘disabling the ports of a computer which were\\nused during the attack’.\\nThereby, all these three components constitute a whole\\nsecurity structure and cannot be considered separately in\\ndefending WSNs and IoT against diverse kinds of attacks.\\nIn the literature, various surveys are provided to present\\nsecurity issues in WSNs: Butun et al.

       " Document(page_content='BUTUN et al. : SECURITY OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS - DRAFT VERSION 5\\n2.1 Passive Attacks\\nPassive attacks are performed in a way that it cannot be\\nsensed by any means. This is because of the fact that the\\nadversaries do not make any radio emissions. Since wireless\\nlinks are easier to tap, wireless networks are more suscepti-\\nble to passive attacks, such as eavesdropping, which can be\\nperformed easily listening to the wireless communication\\namongst sensor nodes in the WSN without capturing any of\\nthem. Passive attacks are mainly against data conﬁdentiality.\\nIn passive attacks, attackers are typically camouﬂaged,\\ni.e. hidden, and tap the communication lines to collect data.\\nPassive attacks can be grouped into eavesdropping, node\\nmalfunctioning, node tampering/destruction, node outage\\nand trafﬁc analysis types (see Fig. 3) [1].\\nHere, it is important to state that node malfunctioning,\\nnode outage and node tampering are considered as active\\nattacks in some papers [14], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62],\\n[63]. We present them as passive attacks in this paper, hence\\nthey do not introduce big concern (they do not constitute\\na single point of failure, as the network can continue its\\noperation without the contribution of the failed nodes!)\\nto the network compared to other more impactive active\\nattacks.\\n2.1.1 Passive Information Gathering (Eavesdropping)\\nEavesdropping is also known as “Passive information gath-\\nering”. Classiﬁed data can be eavesdropped by tapping\\ncommunication lines. Hence wireless links are easier to tap,\\nwireless networks are more susceptible to passive attacks.\\nSince WSNs use short-range communications, an attacker\\nmust be in proximity in order to gather useful information\\nby eavesdropping. WSNs are a little more secure against\\ntapping compared to other long-range wireless technologies\\nbecause signals are sent over shorter distances. Interception\\nof the messages transmitted through WSNs might reveal\\nfollowing useful information: physical location of speciﬁc\\nnodes such as cluster heads, gateways, key distribution\\ncenters, etc.; message identities (IDs), timestamps, other\\nﬁelds, almost anything that is not encrypted.\\n2.1.2 Node Destruction\\nPhysical destruction (with the usage of electrical surge,\\nphysical force or ammunition) of the nodes by any means.\\n2.1.3 Node Malfunctioning\\nThis may happen due to many different factors from faulty\\nsensors or energy depletion due to sensor overwhelming or\\nother DoS attacks.\\n2.1.4 Node Outage\\nThis attack occurs whenever a node fails its regular func-\\ntionality. For example, if a cluster head of a heterogeneous\\nnetwork fails at regular operation, then the WSN protocols\\nhave to be strong enough to mitigate the negative effects\\nof this kind of node outages, by electing new cluster heads\\nand/or providing alternate routes for network paths.2.1.5 Trafﬁc Analysis\\nThe trafﬁc pattern of a network may be as valuable as the\\ncontent of data packets for adversaries. Important infor-\\nmation about the networking topology can be derived by\\nanalyzing trafﬁc patterns. In WSNs, the nodes closer to the\\nbase station, i.e. the sink, make more transmissions than\\nthe other nodes because they relay more packets than the\\nnodes farther from the base station. Similarly, clustering is\\nan important tool for scalability in WSNs and cluster heads\\nare busier than the other nodes in the network. Detection\\nof the base station, the nodes close to it or cluster heads\\nmay be very useful for adversaries because a denial-of-\\nservice attack against these nodes or eavesdropping the\\npackets destined for them may have a greater impact. By\\nanalyzing the trafﬁc, this kind of valuable information can\\nbe derived. Moreover, trafﬁc patterns can pertain to other\\nconﬁdential information such as actions and intentions. In\\ntactical communications, silence may indicate preparation\\nfor an attack, a tactical move or inﬁltration. Similarly, a\\nsudden increase in the trafﬁc rate may indicate the start of a\\ndeliberate attack or raid.\\n2.2 Active Attacks\\nIn the active attacks, malicious acts are carried out not\\nonly against data conﬁdentiality but also data integrity.\\nActive attacks can also aim for unauthorized access and\\nusage of the resources or the disturbance of an opponent’s\\ncommunications. An active attacker makes a radio emission\\nor action that can be sensed by the WSN elements [61]. An\\nexample is DoS attack in the physical and/or network layer\\nthat would cause network elements to drop data packets.\\nA Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack mainly targets the avail-\\nability of network services. A DoS is generally explained as\\nany kind of situation that consumes resources and dimin-\\nishes the capacity of a network, therefore diverts the net-\\nwork from performing its expected functionality correctly\\nor in a timely manner. A node is isolated from the rest of the\\nnetwork by blocking the incoming and outgoing packets. In\\nDoS attack, an adversary attempts to prevent legitimate and\\nauthorized users of services offered by the network from\\naccessing those services. The classic way to achieve this is to\\nﬂood packets to any centralized resource (access point) used\\nin the network so that the resource is no longer available to\\nthe nodes in the network, resulting in the network no longer\\noperating what was designed for. This may lead to a failure\\nin the delivery of guaranteed services to the end users.\\nIn the active attacks, an adversary actually affects the\\noperations of the attacked network. This effect may be the\\nobjective of the attack and can be detected. For example,\\nthe networking services may be degraded or terminated\\nas a result of these attacks. Sometimes the adversary tries\\nto stay undetected, aiming to gain unauthorized access to\\nthe system resources or threatening conﬁdentiality and/or\\nintegrity of the content of the network. Active attacks of our\\ninterest (for WSNs) are grouped into ﬁve main groups, by\\nfollowing the OSI stack protocol layered structure, as shown\\nin Fig. 3.\\nThe OSI network structure consists of 5 layers for WSNs\\n(and IoT) as described in [5]: Physical, Data-Link (MAC),\\nNetwork, Transport, and Application. It should be noted', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\cyber attack.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

X, XX 2019\\nthat Session and Presentation layers of the traditional OSI\\nnetwork model are all considered in the Application layer\\nof WSNs (and IoT).\\n2.2.1 Attacks towards Physical Layer\\n2.2.1.1 Jamming DoS: It is a DoS attack at the\\nphysical layer [62]. A malicious device can jam a signal by\\ntransmitting at the same frequency. The jamming signal con-\\ntributes to the noise in the carrier and its strength is enough\\nto reduce the signal-to-noise ratio below the level that the\\nnodes using that channel need to receive data correctly.\\nJamming can be conducted continuously in a region, which\\nthwarts all the nodes in that region from communication.\\nAlternatively, jamming can be done temporarily with ran-\\ndom time intervals, which can still very effectively hamper\\nthe transmissions.\\n2.2.1.2 Node Capture (Tampering): An adversary\\ntakes over the control of the sensor node by a physical\\nattack, e.g. attaching cables to its circuit board and reading\\nstored data as well as ongoing transmission in the WSN [1].\\nBesides, by tampering adversaries can change the original\\nwiring of the electronic board or change the content of\\nthe memory of the nodes and use the captured slave node\\nby any means. Capturing a node might expose its critical\\ndata, especially revealing of cryptography-related keys and\\ntherefore might cause compromisation of the whole WSN.\\nTwo problems arise in this case:\\n•Captured node can make arbitrary queries on behalf\\nof the attacker (DoS attack against availability).\\n•Captured node can provide false data to the legiti-\\nmate users (attack against integrity).\\n2.2.2 Attacks towards Data Link Layer\\nThe algorithms in the data link layer, especially MAC\\nschemes, present many exploitation opportunities for DoS\\nattacks. For example, MAC layer DoS attacks may continu-\\nously jam a channel. More complex DoS attacks can be de-\\nsigned based on MAC layer addressing schemes. Data link\\nlayer attacks are categorized as follows: Collision, denial of\\nsleep, de-synchronization, exhaustion, ﬂooding, link layer\\njamming, spooﬁng, and unfairness.\\n2.2.2.1 Collision: In collision attack, an adversary\\nstarts transmitting packets from the same channel of a\\nlegitimate node of the network, whenever the legitimate\\none starts transmission. Hence, as a result, both transmitted\\npackets collide and the targeted receiver does not receive\\nthe whole meaningful packet from the transmitter due to\\nthe collision loss in the transmission. Hence it is useless, the\\nreceived packet is discarded and the transmitter is asked\\nfor re-transmission of the packet [19]. Causing collusions\\nof a single byte of a message would be sufﬁcient to cause\\na CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) error and eventually\\ncorrupt the whole message. From the attacker point of\\nview, the collision attack is more advantageous compared\\nto the jamming attack, since consumed transmission energy\\nis lower (because the radio is used just only for a short\\nduration of time) as well as the probability of detection [63].\\n2.2.2.2 Denial of Sleep (Sleep Deprivation Torture):\\nPreventing a node from going to sleep leading to energy de-\\npletion from draining the battery. This can be from collisionattacks or repeated handshaking i.e. Request to Send (RTS)\\nand Clear to Send (CTS) ﬂow control signals. In this attack, a\\nnode is forced to deplete whole energy stored in its batteries\\n[64].\\n2.2.2.3 De-synchronization: Time Synchronized\\nChannel Hopping (TSCH) is a MAC layer protocol\\npresented in IEEE 802.15.4e standard. It empowers extreme\\nconsistency and possesses small duty cycles through the\\ntime synchronization and channel hopping techniques. [65]\\nAttacks against the TSCH time synchronization can happen\\nwhen an attacker transmits the messages in the time-slots\\nthat are alloted to the other users. This causes the packets\\nto collide and to be lost. After carefully observing the\\nback-off times an attacker can cause a series of these events\\nwhich eventually would cause the neighboring motes to be\\nde-synchronized. Hence, this attack can be taught of as an\\nadvanced version of collusion attack.\\n2.2.2.4 Exhaustion: If the collusion attack described\\nabove, continues until the targeted node depletes its energy,\\nthis is called exhaustion attack [63]. This kind of attack can be\\nexecuted by using an ordinary node or a laptop, which have\\nthe ability to transmit radio signals in the same band as the\\nrest of the sensors do.\\n2.2.2.5 Link Layer Flooding: In this type of attack,\\na malicious node abuses the fairness of medium access\\nby sending excessive MAC data packets or MAC control\\npackets to its neighboring nodes. In the end, victim nodes\\nsuffer from DoS or the power of their batteries get ex-\\nhausted. Additionally, this attack may also exhaust channel\\nbandwidth resources. [66]\\n2.2.2.6 Link Layer Jamming: In this type of attack,\\nthe most useful packets, i.e. data packets, are targeted to be\\njammed. The probability distribution of the packet arrival\\ntimes is acquired and used against the packets transmission.\\nThis attack is shown to be successful against these MAC\\nprotocols: B-MAC, L-MAC, and S-MAC [63].\\n2.2.2.7 Spooﬁng/ ARP-Spooﬁng: In the spooﬁng\\nattack, a malicious node spoofs MAC address of another\\nvictim node and then creates a number of various legitimate\\nidentities out of the victim node and uses these identi-\\nties anywhere else in the network [16]. Whereas in ARP-\\nspooﬁng attack, an attacker sends spoofed ARP (Address\\nResolution Protocol) messages into the network. Generally,\\nthe aim is to associate the attacker’s MAC address with\\nthe IP address of a higher ranked node such as the default\\ngateway, causing any trafﬁc meant for that IP address to be\\nsent to the attacker instead.\\n2.2.2.8 Unfairness: Sporadic usage of exhaustion at-\\ntack or mis-usage of cooperative MAC protocols can cause\\nunfairness in the network [57]. Unlike a DoS attack, this\\nattack does not cause a user or a node completely to be\\ndisconnected from the network, but it causes intermittent\\nblackouts in which users send/receive delayed messages.\\nThis attack degrades the quality of service in the network,\\nhence it provides an advantage to the least number of the\\nsensor nodes and disadvantage to the rest of the network,\\nas the rest of the nodes miss their transmission deadlines in\\nreal-time MAC protocol conﬁguration.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\cyber attack.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='BUTUN et al. : SECURITY OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS - DRAFT VERSION 7\\n2.2.3 Attacks towards Network Layer\\nIn the case of network layer attacks , an attacker injects a\\nsigniﬁcant amount of packets into the network which causes\\ncongestion in the network trafﬁc as well as deprivation of\\npower resources throughout the network. Example: “Rout-\\ning table overﬂow attack: Creation of the routes to the\\nnon-existing nodes” [67]. Network layer attacks are catego-\\nrized as HELLO ﬂooding, hole attacks (blackhole, sinkhole,\\nwormhole), node replication, routing, selective forwarding,\\nand Sybil types.\\n2.2.3.1 HELLO-ﬂooding: In this kind of attack, an\\nattacker (has longer transmission range than normal nodes)\\nbroadcasts advertisement messages to the whole network\\nand convinces other nodes that it is located in their neigh-\\nborhood.\\nIn a more technical description; routing protocols broad-\\ncast “HELLO” message to inform of their presence to one-\\nhop neighbors. A node receiving such a packet assumes\\nthat it is within the radio range of the sender which may\\nnot be true during this attack. A malicious node may ﬂood\\n“HELLO” packets with high enough transmission power to\\nconvince every node in the network that it is their neighbor.\\nWhen the other nodes send their packets to the malicious\\nnode, those packets are not received by any node.\\nMany network and MAC layer protocols ask nodes to\\nbroadcast “HELLO” packet for announcing their presence\\ntowards their neighbors. Any node, receiving such a packet\\nmight consider that it is enclosed in the normal radio-\\nrange of the packet sender. This assumption would be\\nfalsiﬁed in some speciﬁc cases as follows: A laptop-class at-\\ntacker broadcasting routing or other information with large\\nenough transmission power could convince every node in\\nthe network that the adversary is its neighbor.\\n“Flooding” is usually used to denote the epidemic-like\\npropagation of a message to every node in the network\\nover a multi-hop topology. In contrast, despite its name, the\\nHELLO ﬂood attack uses a single hop broadcast to transmit\\na message to a large number of receivers [59].\\n2.2.3.2 Hole Attacks:\\n•Blackhole: A malicious node may drop all the pack-\\nets that it receives for forwarding. This attack is\\nespecially effective when the blackhole node is also\\na sinkhole. Such an attack combination may stop all\\nthe data trafﬁc around the blackhole. In some texts,\\nthis attack is also referred as “Selﬁshness”.\\n•Sinkhole: A malicious node can advertise by broad-\\ncasting to all the neighbor nodes that it is the best\\nnext hop for sending the packets to its destination.\\nWhen a node becomes a sinkhole, it becomes the\\nhub for its vicinity and starts receiving all the packets\\ngoing to the base station. All trafﬁc of the network is\\ndirected to this single node but in this case, sinkhole\\nnode does not drop any packets. By this way, it\\nexpects to remain undetected by the IDS. This cre-\\nates many opportunities for any follow-on attacks.\\nSince all trafﬁc of the network passes through this\\nparticular node which literally “sinks” all the data it\\nreceives, the name is given to this attack.\\n•Selective Forwarding (Grayhole): It is a special kind\\nof blackhole attack, in which malicious node actsmore cleverly and does not drop every packet it\\nreceives but the ones it selects. By this way, attacker\\nexpects to remain undetected by the IDS. This type\\nof attack is also called “grayhole attack” as it is a\\nvariant of blackhole attack.\\nSimilar to sinkhole attacks, a malicious node sub-\\nverts the routing protocol by making itself part of\\nmany routes but instead of dropping of all packets\\nselectively drop some packets while forwarding oth-\\ners in order to avoid detection. Forwarding packets\\nis a major responsibility of a routing node. However,\\na malicious node intentionally may drop any packet\\nand forward other ones.\\nMulti hopped networks are generally built upon the\\nfollowing assumption: The participant sensor nodes\\nwould be faithful in forwarding the messages they\\nreceive. In a selective-forwarding attack, adversary\\nnodes might reject forwarding some certain mes-\\nsages by simply dropping them and making sure\\nthat these packets are not distributed anymore. As\\nan example of this kind of attack, a malicious node\\nbehaves like a blackhole and refuses to forward every\\npacket it receives. However, such an attacker has the\\nfollowing risk: Neighboring nodes will conclude that\\nit has failed and they may decide to seek another\\nroute. A more subtle form of this attack is when an\\nadversary selectively forwards packets. An adver-\\nsary interested in suppressing or modifying pack-\\nets originating from a select few nodes can reliably\\nforward the remaining trafﬁc and limit suspicion of\\nhis/her wrongdoing.\\n•Wormhole: A tunnel (out of the band fast transmis-\\nsion path) is created between two nodes that can be\\nutilized to transmit packets in a faster way. This way,\\ntwo far parts of the network advertised as neighbors\\nto attract the surrounding trafﬁc [68].\\nA malicious node can eavesdrop or receive data\\npackets at a point and transfer them to another\\nmalicious node, which is at another part of the net-\\nwork, through an out-of-band channel. The second\\nmalicious node then replays the packets. This makes\\nall the nodes that can hear the transmissions by\\nthe second malicious node believe that the node\\nthat sent the packets to the ﬁrst malicious node is\\ntheir single-hop neighbor and they are receiving the\\npackets directly from it. The packets that follow the\\nnormal route reach destination node, later than those\\nconveyed through the wormhole and are therefore\\ndropped because they do more hops - wormholes\\nare typically established through faster channels.\\nWormholes are very difﬁcult to detect and can\\nimpact on the performance of many network services\\nsuch as time synchronization, localization, and data\\nfusion.\\n2.2.3.3 Node-Replication (Clone): An attacker in-\\ntentionally puts replicas of a compromised node in many\\nplaces in the network to incur inconsistency. Node-\\nreplication (clone) attack is one of the particularly most\\ndreadful attacks hence it causes an attacker to be able to\\ndivert the behavior of a network by just using a few copies', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\cyber attack.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='8 TO BE APPEAR AT: IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS, VOL. XX, NO. X, XX 2019\\nof a previously hacked nodes [69]. Like the Sybil attack, the\\nnode-replication (clone) attack also can enable attackers to\\nsubvert data aggregation, misbehavior detection, and voting\\nprotocols by injecting false data or suppressing legitimate\\ndata [70].\\n2.2.3.4 Routing Attacks:\\n•Misdirection: In misdirection attack, an attacker for-\\nwards ongoing messages to the wrong paths inten-\\ntionally. This can be achieved by fabricating false\\nrouting advertisements and causing routing tables of\\nthe neighboring nodes’ to update these false informa-\\ntion [57]. This attack is also categorized as DoS attack,\\nhence targeted nodes are blacked out completely\\nand do not receive any further packets after the\\nadvertisement of the false routing information.\\n•Network Partitioning: A fully connected network\\nis portioned to sub-networks in which the nodes\\nin different sub-networks cannot communicate each\\nother although they are connected.\\n•Routing Loop: A routing loop is introduced in a\\nroute path. It is created by spooﬁng routing updates.\\nSuppose an adversary can determine that node A\\nand node B are within radio range of each other. An\\nadversary can send a forged routing update to node\\nB with a spoofed source address indicating it came\\nfrom node A. Node B will then mark node A as its\\nparent and rebroadcast the routing update. Node A\\nwill then hear the routing update from node B and\\nmark B as its parent. Messages sent to either A or B\\nwill be forever forwarded in a loop between the two\\nof them. This leads to energy depletion and eventual\\nnode/network failure [59].\\n•Rushing: When this attack is performed against “on-\\ndemand ad hoc network routing protocols”, it results\\nin DoS in the network. For instance; AODV , DSR,\\nand more secure protocols based on these, i.e. ARAN,\\nSAODV , and Ariadne, are not capable of discovering\\nroutes that are longer than two-hops when they are\\nsubjected to this kind of attack. The rushing attack\\nis especially harmful to networks hence it can be\\nexecuted by relatively weak adversaries [71].\\n•Spoofed, Altered or Replayed Routing Information:\\nRouting information exchanged among nodes can\\nbe altered by malicious nodes to have a detrimental\\neffect on the routing scheme.\\n2.2.3.5 RPL Exploit: IoT consist of devices that are\\nlimited in resource like battery powered, memory, process-\\ning capability, etc. For this kind o networks, a new network\\nlayer routing protocol is designed called RPL (Routing Pro-\\ntocol for Low-power and lossy networks) [72]. RPL is light\\nweight and does not have the full functionality of traditional\\nrouting protocols. RPL was proposed especially for data-\\nsinks (multi-point to point communications) and is being\\nadopted by IoT recently. Many attacks against the RPL of\\nIoT have been presented in [73].\\nAs discussed and proposed in our paper, IoT is also\\nsusceptible to most of the attacks against WSNs. The attacks\\npresented in [73] and [74] support this idea in a sense that\\nother than a few attacks (which are speciﬁcally against RPL\\nprotocol), all of the attacks are same as the “Attacks againstRouting Layer” presented in this section. These speciﬁc\\nattacks against RPL protocol are: Local-Repair attack, Rank\\nattack , DODAG version attack, DIS attack, and ﬁnally\\nNeighbor attack. [73]\\nIn local repair attack, an attacker intentionally and peri-\\nodically sends the local repair message which is originally\\nused for improvement of the link quality. This causes the\\nneighboring nodes to go into local repair cycle. This attack\\ncreates more impact on delivery ratio than any other kind\\nof attack, generates more control packets and increases the\\nend to end delay [73].\\nDODAG stands for Destination Oriented Directed\\nAcyclic Graph, which is created by RPL by forming a loop-\\nfree topology. DODAG organizes nodes in a hierarchical\\nmanner as single root, children and their further descen-\\ndants [75].\\nIn RPL, rank value increases from root to child node. In\\nRPL DODAG rank attack, an attacker can exploit DODAG\\nversion system by advancing its rank in the hierarchical\\ntree and gaining many children which are forced to route\\npackets through the attacker parent. So, by intentionally\\nchanging the ranking value of itself, an attacker can attract\\nmany child nodes for selecting it as parent, and thereby at-\\ntracts large trafﬁc going toward the root node (main branch)\\nto ﬂow through itself.\\nAnother exploit of RPL DODAG version system is called\\nDODAG version attack. It is executed by publishing a\\nhigher version number of the DODAG tree. When nodes\\nreceive the new higher version number in the DODAG\\nInformation Object (DIO) messages, they start forming a\\nnew DODAG tree. This can cause the generation of new\\nun-optimized topology and will bring inconsistencies in\\nthe network topology. The loops and rank inconsistencies\\ncreated by the attack are generally located around the neigh-\\nborhood of the attacker. [73]\\nIn DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS) attack, an at-\\ntacker sends DIS messages with fake IP addresses which\\ncauses the recipient node to re-generate the DIO messages,\\nwhich eventually increases the overhead.\\nIn RPL neighbor attack, a malicious node broadcast DIO\\nmessages that it received without adding information of\\nitself. The node which receives this type of message may\\nthink that new neighbor node is sending this DIO message.\\nThe victim node tries to change the routing tables so that\\nthe pointed node is also included. This attack is somehow\\nsimilar to the selective forwarding attack in which DIO mes-\\nsages selected only. This attack affects network by slightly\\nincreases the end to end delay, change in network topology,\\nand some control overhead. However, it might have serious\\nconsequences when combined with other attacks.\\n2.2.3.6 6LoWPAN Exploit: 6LoWPAN is an Internet\\nprotocol devised for the IoT for the sake of extended us-\\nage of IPv6 by the smart-things. 6LoWPAN integrates IP-\\nbased infrastructures and WSNs by specifying how IPv6\\npackets are to be routed in constrained networks such as\\nIEEE 802.15.4 networks by fragmentation and reassembly of\\ndatagram data ﬁelds.\\nA speciﬁc attack for 6LoWPAN is fragment duplication\\nattack, in which an attacker puts his own fragments in the\\nfragmentation chain. The fragment duplication attack takes\\nthe advantage of the fact that a recipient cannot verify at', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\cyber attack.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='BUTUN et al. : SECURITY OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS - DRAFT VERSION 9\\nthe 6LoWPAN layer if a fragment originates from the same\\nsource as previously received fragments of the same IPv6\\npacket. Hence no authentication mechanism exists on the re-\\nceiver at the time of reception for checking whether received\\nfragment is an original or spoofed duplicate fragment, this\\nattack can easily fool the receiver. The receiver cannot\\ndistinguish legitimate fragments from spoofed duplicates.\\nInstead, it has to process all fragments that appear to belong\\nto the same IPv6 packet according to the sender’s MAC\\naddress and the 6LoWPAN datagram tag. Thus, an attacker\\ncan pretend as a legitimate node and exploit this weakness\\nto engage in further attacks such as a DoS attack. [73], [76].\\n2.2.3.7 Sybil Attack: A single node presents multi-\\nple identities to other nodes of the network. This causes con-\\nfusion in the network; nodes receive contradicting routing\\npaths that are passing through the attacker. This reduces\\nthe effectiveness of fault-tolerance schemes and poses a\\nsigniﬁcant threat to geographic routing protocols [77]. Apart\\nfrom these services it may also affect the performance of\\nother schemes such as misbehavior detection, voting-based\\nalgorithms, data aggregation, fusion and distributed storage\\n[?].\\n2.2.4 Attacks towards Transport Layer\\nThe transport layer of the OSI protocol stack manages\\nend-to-end connections of the two nodes. At the transport\\nlayer, attacks exploit the protocols that maintain connection\\ninformation at either end. [60] All transport layer attacks are\\ncategorized and described as follows:\\n2.2.4.1 De-Synchronization: An attacker disrupts\\nactual links among two nodes by de-synchronizing the\\ntransmissions in between them. An example of this type of\\nattack is sending fabricated messages, such as faulty ﬂag\\nkind of sequences, (by transmitting forged packets with\\nbogus sequence numbers or control ﬂags that desynchro-\\nnize endpoints so that they will re-transmit the data [60])\\ncontinuously to both sides of the communicating parties, as\\na result, to force them losing their synchronization [57], [63].\\n2.2.4.2 MQTT Exploit: The Message Queue Teleme-\\ntry Transport (MQTT) [78] is a lightweight publish-and-\\nsubscribe connectivity protocol aimed at working on\\nresource-constrained devices such as low power embedded\\nsensors to enable them communicating. In the IoT con-\\ntext, MQTT is widely used to enable the communication\\nbetween devices using a publish-and-subscribe messaging\\napproach. However, MQTT does not include security layer\\nby default and it is the user’s responsibility to address\\nsecurity issues. In this direction, it is suggested to enable\\nsecurity for MQTT by issuing SSL/TLS with certiﬁcates and\\nsession key management. That is being said, owing to the\\nmultitude of heterogeneous devices, storing and managing\\nthe certiﬁcates and key exchanges for every session of IoT is\\nburdensome. Furthermore, SSL/TLS can suffer from attacks\\nsuch as BEAST, CRIME, RC4, and Heartbleed. Thus a scal-\\nable, lightweight and robust security mechanism is required\\nfor MQTT and its variants for deployment in IoT. [79]\\n2.2.4.3 Session Hijacking: In computer science, this\\nattack is referred as the “exploitation of” and “tampering\\nwith” a valid communication session (which is also called as\\nsession key) to gain unauthorized access on information or\\nservices of a system. As being an extension of IP networks,session hijacking of TCP messages will also be affecting and\\ntroublesome for IoT networks.\\n2.2.4.4 SYN-ﬂooding: In a ﬂooding attack, an at-\\ntacker aims at exhausting the energy and/or the memory\\nof a node, by ﬂooding it with spurious messages. This\\nis achieved, for instance, by sending multiple connection\\nrequests without ever completing the connection, thus over-\\nwhelming the buffer and eventually causing the node to be\\ndead [57], [63].\\nMore speciﬁcally, in a TCP SYN (synchronize) ﬂood-\\ning attack, an adversary sends multiple TCP connection\\nrequests without ever completing the connection, thus over-\\nwhelming the target’s half-open connection buffer. [60]\\n2.2.5 Attacks towards Application Layer\\nApplication layer protocols can also be exploited by DoS at-\\ntacks. Protocols like node localization, time synchronization,\\ndata aggregation, association, and fusion can be cheated or\\nhindered. For example, a malicious node that impersonates\\na beacon node and gives false location information or cheats\\nwith regard to its transmission power, i.e. transmitting with\\nless or more power than it is supposed to do, may hamper\\nthe node localization scheme. Since this kind of attack\\ndiminishes the related network service, they can also be\\ncategorized as DoS attacks. An example of application layer\\nDoS attack is path-based DoS attack and will be described\\nbelow. All application layer attacks are categorized and\\ndescribed as follows:\\n2.2.5.1 CoAP Exploit: Constrained Application Pro-\\ntocol (CoAP) [80] is an application layer protocol designed\\nas a replication of the HTTP for the small devices of IoT to\\nprovide communication ability with the rest of the Internet.\\nRecently, many implementations of IoT are using CoAP ,\\nwhich indicates that it will have a crucial role in the future\\nof IoT applications.\\nAs mentioned in [81], there are several challenges related\\nto security by the introduction of CoAP . It does not translate\\nfull functionality of HTTP , which creates security problems\\nfor multicast messages.\\n2.2.5.2 False Data Injection: In order to inﬂuence the\\noverall result of a measurement or a reading, captured nodes\\nintentionally inject false data in the WSN. Therefore, it can\\nbe stated that this attack happens in a semantic level, hence\\nit does not affect anything but the logic.\\n2.2.5.3 Path-based DoS: As the name implies, this\\nattack is a DoS attack that happens in the application layer.\\nIn this attack; an attacker overwhelms nodes but this time\\nfrom long distance by again ﬂooding an end-to-end com-\\nmunications path with either fabricated packets or replayed\\npackets [82]. So, as a result, all the nodes along the path,\\nfrom the source to destination (attacker to the base station)\\nare affected by this attack.\\n2.2.5.4 Re-programming: Once in a while, ev-\\nery network element either needs to be patched or\\nre-programmed for version control, code acquisition,\\nencoding-decoding, or when switching to a newly written\\nprogram. That’s also true for WSNs and IoT. If this re-\\nprogramming (or patch management per say) schedule is\\nnot kept secret, then adversaries can take advantage of this\\nvulnerable time of the network by simply sending bogus', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\cyber attack.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

Targeting sen-\\nsors with spurious interference or completely overwhelm-\\ning them with fake messages and inundating them with\\nfalse stimuli.\\n3 D EFENDING AGAINST VARIOUS ATTACKS TO -\\nWARDS THE WSN S AND IOT\\nRouting protocols can be designed such that an adversary\\ncannot compromise nodes/messages or make the routing\\nscheme dysfunction. This is the most effective approach\\nwith respect to the cost of the security scheme and effec-\\ntiveness in defense of WSNs against the threats. Therefore,\\nmost of the techniques fall into this category.\\nPreventive approaches are designed to counter known\\nthreats and may not be effective against new threats. De-\\ntection schemes for misbehaving or malfunctioning nodes\\ncan be designed in a more generic fashion. On the other\\nhand, they can be more costly than preventive approaches.\\nFinally, routing can be designed such that it still delivers the\\ndata packets to the destination when there is an attack. Such\\nresilient techniques are also costly.\\nFollowing subsections provide solutions (strategies and\\ntechniques) to defend (detect, prevent or mitigate) against\\nvarious attacks towards the WSNs on all of the layers of the\\nOSI protocol stack:\\n3.1 Defense against Passive Attacks\\n3.1.1 Defense against Passive Information Gathering\\nThe communications in WSNs are achieved through the\\nair, and therefore we do not know whether the packets\\narrive the intended people only or not. Hence detection of\\neavesdropping is almost impossible.\\nLink layer encryption would prevent outsider attacks\\nsuch as eavesdropping, and some of the solutions are pro-\\nvided in [59], [84], [85], [86], [87]. The bulk of the external\\nattacks towards WSNs can be avoided by link-layer en-\\ncryption and authentication by using globally-shared keys.\\nFor example, to provide link layer encryption, Karlof et al.\\n[88] proposed TinySec for WSNs. SNEP (Secure Network\\nEncryption Protocol) under the SPINS [84] protocol set, is\\nalso one another famous encryption protocol that is devised\\nfor WSNs.\\nIn [89], authors proposed SensorWare communication\\nmulticast model in which 3 different levels of link-layer\\nencryption are provided by using the RC6 algorithm. They\\nhave chosen the RC6 algorithm, because its selection of\\nthe number of rounds parameter, has a direct effect on the\\nsecurity level of the algorithm. An initial set of master keys\\nare shared by all sensors in the network. At any time, one of\\nthe master keys in the list of the master keys is active. The\\nreason is, in order to expose less data for known-ciphertext\\nattacks, more keys will be necessary as the lifetime of the\\nnetwork extends. This selection of the keys is executed\\npseudo-random way, every node uses the same seed for\\nrandomizing function. Then, the random number is coupled\\nto the list of the master keys to obtain the active master key.TABLE 1\\nSolutions to defend WSNs against DoS attacks\\nDoS attack Defense strategy\\nRadio interference Usage of spread-spectrum communication\\nPhysical tampering Usage of tamper-resistant nodes\\nDenying channel Usage of error correction codes\\nBlackhole Usage of multiple routing paths\\nMisdirection Usage of source authorization\\nFlooding Limiting the total number of connections\\nFor the rest of the security model, the required keys for the\\n3 different levels of security are gathered from this active\\nmaster key.\\nRandom key pre-distribution schemes [90], [91], [92]\\nhelp link layer encryption schemes by distributing the keys\\nneeded by the encryption algorithms, hence they help WSNs\\nto protect information in transit and prevent eavesdropping,\\ndata and information spooﬁng.\\n3.2 Defense against Active Attacks\\nIn Table 1, some of the solutions [93] to defend WSNs\\nagainst various DoS attacks are summarized. However, this\\npresentation is too generic and that’s why we needed to\\npresent Table 2 in an effort to give the whole picture with a\\ndetailed categorization.\\n3.2.1 Defense on Physical Layer\\nIn [94], authors propose a cross-layer security mechanism,\\nnamely “Swarm Intelligence”, to detect Jamming-DoS at-\\ntacks. They also provide countermeasures to mitigate this\\nkind of attack. JAM −a jammed area mapping service\\n[95], is proposed for detecting jamming DoS attack against\\nWSNs. JAM provided a mapping protocol to detect a\\njammed region in a WSN. Besides, in terms of mitigation,\\nJAM avoided the jammed part of the WSN by re-routing\\nthe packets thus provided a remedy for the Jamming DoS\\nattack.\\nIn [96], authors proposed wormhole technique, normally\\nknown to be an attack against WSNs, which could be\\neffectively used to defer Jamming DoS attack against WSNs.\\nIn order to defend WSN from node tampering attacks,\\nnodes might be equipped with tamper-resistant hardware,\\nin which any kind of tamper attempt would wipe out the\\nmemory (and also any other data storage) so that conﬁ-\\ndential information (such as the secret keys) would not be\\nleaked. Although this is a wise and excellent solution, it\\ncomes with an additional cost of hardware which would\\nincrease the total cost of the WSN installation and cripple\\nthe most appealing feature of such networks: “low cost”.\\nOther ways of ﬁghting against node tampering would be\\ndisabling JTAG interface of the sensors and the use of good\\npassword protection for the bootstrap loader of the sensor\\nboards [63]. Finally, a na ¨ıve way of protecting the nodes\\nagainst this kind of attacks would be simply hiding the\\nnodes by camouﬂaging [18].\\nDetection of the tampering attempts would require rou-\\ntinely physical checking of the sensor nodes by eye or with\\nspecial equipment such as magniﬁers. Though, this task\\nmight be tedious considering the fact that sometimes nodes', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\cyber attack.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Another solution would be the\\nemployment of time division multiplexing (TDM) technique\\nwhich would provide dedicated time slots to each node to\\ntransmit their packets. This would allow each node to have\\na tiny period of time to access the channel. By this way, the\\nchannel usage of each node is limited and attacks related\\nto channel abusing are prevented. If the corruption of the\\npackets occurs partially (in bursts), employment of error\\ndetection and error correction codes would be beneﬁcial\\ntools to ﬁght against this kind of attacks [18].\\n3.2.2.2 Defense against Denial of Sleep and Link\\nLayer Flooding: Liu et al.’s anomaly detection-based IDS\\nproposal works on ad hoc networks and therefore ﬁts\\nwell to the WSNs and IoT. In their proposal, each node\\nparticipates to the detection of the abnormal nodes. Packet\\ntrafﬁc at MAC layer is analyzed and evaluated. Distributed\\nand cooperative anomaly detection is achieved by creating\\nfeature vectors at each node and then fulﬁlling cross-feature\\nanalyses. This is resulted with local or global response (ei-\\nther response from single node or a collaborative response\\nfrom multiple nodes) according to the seriousness of the\\nattack situation. The proposed IDS has shown to be effective\\nagainst MAC layer attacks, especially on denial of sleep and\\nﬂooding attacks. [66]\\n3.2.2.3 Defense against De-synchronization: Many\\napplications require the IoT to have a low and deterministic\\ndelay, especially for IIoT applications where delay tolerance\\nis low. Having a deterministic network delay in a WSN is\\nchallenging in the best case when traditional MAC protocols\\nare employed. To enable low power, high reliability and\\ndeterministic WSNs, IETF recently proposed 6TiSCH pro-\\ntocol that uses time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) MAC\\nwith IPv6 addressing. This protocol dynamically assigns\\nbandwidth resources to the nodes in the network according\\nto the application requirements, hence it provides a commu-\\nnications stack for low power and lossy networks such as\\nIoT. The proposal includes secure communication of MAC\\nlayer frames so that any kind of eavesdropping or packet\\ncapturing would have no beneﬁt of these. [97]\\n3.2.2.4 Defense against Unfairness: In [57], usage of\\nsmall frames is offered as a defense solution to this kind of\\nattack. By this way, an attacker would capture the channel\\nonly for a small period of time and unfairness would be\\navoided.\\n3.2.3 Defense on Network Layer\\n3.2.3.1 Defense against Blackhole: Liu et al.’s\\nanomaly detection-based IDS proposal works on each node\\nand have also shown to be effective (but less compared\\nto detecting attacks against MAC layer) on network layer,\\nespecially for detection of blackhole and grayhole (packet-\\ndropping) attacks. [66]In [98], authors proposed REWARD scheme, in order to\\ndetect blackhole attacks against WSNs. Besides, this scheme\\nprovides a routing algorithm, in which detected blackholes\\nare avoided hence the WSN resumes normal operation\\nunder blackhole attack.\\nIn [99], authors discussed the effects of network topology\\nselection in WSNs on blackhole attacks. Their ﬁndings sug-\\ngest that mesh topology is more resilient against blackhole\\nattacks compared to star and tree topologies.\\nIn [100], Prathapani et al. proposed the use of Honeypots,\\nwhich are strolling software agents that create dummy\\nRoute-Request (RREQ) packets to attract and catch black-\\nhole attack performers. Authors have illustrated the positive\\nperformance of the proposed detection approach by exten-\\nsive simulation results using the ns-2 simulator.\\nWatchdog based intrusion detection system proposed in\\n[101], is efﬁcient in detecting blackhole and selective for-\\nwarding attacks. Sensor nodes in the clustered-WSN watch\\ntheir neighbors and collaborate with the head of the cluster\\nin order to be able to detect misbehavior. Although sensor\\nnodes do not have an exhaustive view of the network,\\nstill they can be effective in detecting intrusions with some\\ndeﬁnite probability and report it to the head of the cluster.\\nIn [102], Medadian et al. presented a method to cope\\nwith the blackhole attacks which introduces negotiating\\nwith neighboring nodes that claim to possess a route to the\\ndestination. If a node receives an RREP packet (correspond-\\ning answer to an RREQ packet) then it forwards this packet\\nto the source and starts an evaluation procedure about the\\nreplier. The evaluation procedure is based upon opinions of\\nthe nodes about the replier. All activities of a node are saved\\nby its neighbors. Whenever the neighbors of a particular\\nnode are asked to send their opinions about it, requester\\nnode gathers all opinions of the neighbors and concludes\\nabout the maliciousness of the replier node. The conclusion\\nis based on several rules. According to authors’ simulation\\nresults, it has shown that the presented MAODV protocol\\nprovided not only better security but also performed better\\nin terms of packet delivery ratio than the legacy AODV\\nprotocol in the existence of blackholes with minimum added\\ndelay and overhead.\\nIn ActiveTrust [103], in order to detect blackhole attacks\\nin WSNs, authors have created multi-detection routes in the\\nareas which have remaining energy. Hence an adversary\\ndoes not know the detection routes, (s)he will target those\\nand while executing the action (s)he will be disclosed. By\\nthis method, location and behavior of an adversary can be\\ndetermined by ActiveTrust to be used for avoiding black-\\nholes during the creation of the ﬁnal data routes.\\nIn [104], authors presented a technique for detecting\\nand preventing blackhole attacks in clustered-WSNs. In this\\nmethodology, a node called coordinator is selected by all\\nnodes dependent on the cluster-head election criterion. Co-\\nordinator node has the responsibility in the authentication\\nprocess, detection of intermediate node failures as well as\\nblackhole attacks. If a blackhole attacker is detected in the\\ncluster, then the coordinator removes it from the cluster,\\nhence all the communications with this speciﬁc node are\\nterminated.\\nMisra et al.

Presented\\nmethod demands transmission of extra copies of a packet\\nfrom each node to all base stations. To ensure that every\\nnode has a route to it, each base station uses TinyOS\\nbeaconing. The beacon packet from any BS consists of: the\\nID of the sender of the packet, the ID of the base station\\nfrom which it originated, and the hop count of the sender\\nfrom the base station to the node. This beaconing process\\ncreates a routing tree in the network and used for detection\\nand mitigation of blackhole attacks against the network.\\nAccording to their simulation results, authors have shown\\nthat the proposed method has achieved over 99% success\\nrate in packet deliveries in the presence of blackhole attack.\\nIn [106], Amouri et al. proposed a framework of intru-\\nsion detection for MANETs. The framework considered a\\nhierarchical architecture where the intrusion detection is\\ndistributed through a set of promiscuous zones (PZ). Unlike\\nthe traditional approach where the nodes are promiscuous\\nall the time, in their scheme the nodes are promiscuous for\\nthe period that they are in the PZ. Once a node leaves\\nthe virtual PZ its promiscuity is turned off in order to\\nsave energy. Authors have used a C4.5 decision tree to\\nlearn the network behavior under blackhole attack, and\\nafter exhaustive evaluation, authors have shown that their\\napproach was able to recognize blackhole attacks with up to\\n97% accuracy.\\n3.2.3.2 Defense against HELLO Flooding: One pos-\\nsible solution to this problem is provided in [59]: Force\\nevery node to authenticate each of its neighbors with an\\nidentity veriﬁcation protocol using a trusted base station.\\nIf the protocol sends messages in both directions over the\\nlink between the nodes, HELLO ﬂoods are prevented when\\nthe adversary only has a powerful transmitter because the\\nprotocol veriﬁes the bi-directionality of the link.\\nIn [107], authors presented a shared-secret method based\\non probability to defend against HELLO ﬂooding attack.\\nThe proposed method has 2 steps in terms of defense: 1)\\nBidirectional veriﬁcation technique to detect HELLO ﬂoods.\\n2) “Multi-path multi-base station routing” in order to defer\\nHELLO ﬂoods.\\nµ-TESLA “(Micro Timed Efﬁcient Streaming Loss-\\ntolerant Authentication) protocol”, under the SPINS [84]\\nprotocol set, has been proposed to provide authenticated\\nbroadcasting in an effort to prevent HELLO ﬂooding attack;\\nand achieved this by employing symmetric key cryptogra-\\nphy which required minimum packet overhead.\\n3.2.3.3 Defense against Node-Replication (Clone):\\nIn [108] and [109], authors proposed location based Public\\nKey Cryptography (PKC) algorithms in order to prevent\\nclone attacks. Every sensor node has a private key associ-\\nated with the location of itself. These location-based keys\\nare employed to prevent node replications.\\nIn detecting clone attacks, there are a variety of solutions\\nprovided. More interested readers would refer to [10], hence\\ndetailed comparisons of the schemes proposed to detect\\nnode-replication attacks are provided in. Here, they are\\nsummarized under 2 categories:\\nCentralized Solutions: Conventional methods to detect\\na node replication attack usually include centralized com-\\nputing based on node locations or the number of simultane-ous connections, which is vulnerable to the single-point fail-\\nure [70]. Mostly, centralized detection schemes do not have\\nsigniﬁcant advantages over distributed detection schemes;\\nand bear similar deﬁciencies (such as any compromisation\\nat the base-station would transform the provided-solution\\nto an ineffective one).\\nChoi et al. [110] presented a scheme to detect centralized\\nnode-replication attacks and named it as “SET”. SET aims at\\nreducing the overhead caused by the detection, with compu-\\ntation set of operations (“intersection”, “union”) related to\\nexclusive subsets of the WSN. Not only SET protocol is very\\ncomplicated to implement (owing to complex components\\nlike interleaved authentication and authenticated subset\\ncovering), but also has an increased overload.\\nBrooks et al. [111] presented a protocol to detect clone\\nattacks based on “random pairwise key pre-distribution\\nschemes”. Proposed scheme addressed the problem of de-\\ntecting replicated cryptographic keys instead of the repli-\\ncated sensor nodes. By analyzing statistical data from the\\nsensor node authentications, the proposed scheme detects\\nthe replicated keys as follows: The keys that are exceeding\\na predeﬁned usage count (threshold) are declared as repli-\\ncated and revoked from the WSN.\\nXing et al. [112] presented a method to detect node-\\nreplication attacks with the encoded information related to\\nnodes’ community network called the “social ﬁngerprint”.\\nIn this method, nodes collaborate to create each other’s\\nﬁngerprints then send these data to the base station for fur-\\nther conclusion process. However, in the proposed scheme,\\nthe expected number of nodes is not adjustable; therefore\\nnot only node addition but also node revocation cannot be\\nmanaged, causing the ﬂexibility of the WSN to disappear.\\nHoet al. [113] presented an efﬁcient and fast node-\\nreplication detection model for mobile WSNs called “speed\\ntest”. In this model, the base-stations compute the instant\\nmaximum speed of a node, and denote it as Vmax and then\\ncompare it with the system conﬁgured maximum theoretical\\nspeedVmax −T. An authentic node should be never mov-\\ning faster than Vmax −T. If the instant-measured Vmax is\\nto be found above the conﬁgured Vmax −T, then it is most\\nprobable that there are at least two sensor nodes using the\\nsame ID in the WSN, the indication of a replication attack.\\nAlthough the proposed scheme sounds very appealing,\\nit might introduce errors causing high false-negative and\\nfalse-positive outcomes due to the synchronization errors.\\nButun et al. [114] proposed an IDS system for clustered-\\nWSNs based on multi-level clustering. In their approach, all\\nthe member nodes of each cluster share secret keys with\\ntheir cluster head. Each node is speciﬁc to their unique\\ncluster and cannot be used in any other cluster elsewhere\\nin the network. Therefore, any attempt of node replication\\nattack is easily detected and prevented by using this kind of\\nclustered approach.\\nDistributed Solutions: In [70], Parno et al. presented a\\nmethod for distributed detection of the clone attacks. On\\nthis approach, each sensor node is considered to know its\\nown location, and it is mandatory to send this location\\ninformation to a set of watchdog sensors. If a watchdog\\nsensor detects an abuse in the location declarations of a\\nsensor node, this node then becomes as suspicious of having\\na replicated (once or more) identity in the network.

[69]. In their proposal, “HIP-HOP\\n(History Information-exchange Protocol and its optimized\\nversion)” protocol is devised. Proposed protocols make use\\nof local neighborhood (one-hop) communications and mo-\\nbility of nodes, and can be considered as light-weight for the\\namount of computation required. While detecting clones,\\nthe proposed protocols work in an effective, distributed and\\ncooperative way.\\nIn node-to-network broadcasting (N2NB) scheme\\n[70], the whole network is ﬂooded by every node with\\nauthenticated-broadcast messages. This is in an effort of\\neach node by claiming its own location. In the pre-condition\\nthat the broadcast messages reach each node, the N2NB\\nprotocol is reported to achieve 100% detection rate.\\nIn deterministic multicast (DM) scheme [70], the aim\\nof the design is to reduce the communications cost, and the\\nmain goal is sending location claim of a node only towards\\na certain number of nodes, chosen in a deterministic way, to\\nserve as watchdogs in the network.\\n“Randomized multicast (RM)” and “line-selected multi-\\ncast (LSM)” protocols are two probabilistic algorithms, both\\nproposed by Parno et al. [70]. RM protocol dissipates node-\\nlocation claims to a selected random number of watchdogs,\\nleveraging “combinatorics theory” in detecting replicas;\\nwhile LSM leverages the network topology related to rout-\\ning to assign extra watchdogs for the claimer and employs\\n“geometric probability” methodology for the detection.\\nZhu et al. [115] presented 2 schemes: “Single determin-\\nistic cell (SDC)” and “parallel multiple probabilistic cells\\n(P-MPC)”. Both schemes are derived from DM, and can be\\nemployed as “network-wide deterministic multicast” proto-\\ncol, followed by probabilistic storage and in-cell broadcast\\nmethodologies.\\nConti et al. [116] presented “randomized, efﬁcient, and\\ndistributed (RED) protocol”. This method combined both\\nadvantages of RM and DM. In the state of the art, RED is\\none of the most appealing clone-detection algorithms.\\nIn [117], Zhang et al. proposed 4 clone-detection proto-\\ncols with the name of “memory efﬁcient multicast (MEM)”.\\nLi and Gong [118] proposed a simple form of N2NB\\nnamed as “randomly directed exploration (RDE)”, in which\\nlocation claims along with the claimer’s neighborhood list\\nare sent so that each of the forwarding nodes on the path\\nfairly constitutes a line. RDE is only feasible for ideal\\nnetwork model, hence detection rate might not be at an\\nimportant level even for a convex deployment ﬁeld.\\n3.2.3.4 Defense against Selective Forwarding (Gray-\\nhole): There are two approaches to defend against selective\\nforwarding attacks:\\n•Detecting the nodes that selectively forwarding.\\n•Developing routing schemes that are more resilient\\nand can deliver packets even when there is a selective\\nforwarding attack.\\nOne approach in detecting the nodes that are selectively\\nforwarding is based on acknowledgments [119]. Every inter-\\nmediate node that forwards a packet waits for an acknowl-edgment from the next hop. If the next hop node does not\\nreturn the same number of acknowledgments as the number\\nof packets sent, the node generates an alarm about the next\\nhop node. However, compromised nodes can also generate\\nacknowledgments for the packets that they dropped, which\\nmake this scheme fail.\\nMulti-path routing can be an effective way to mitigate se-\\nlective forwarding and blackhole attacks [59]. This requires\\nat least link-disjoint paths, where two paths may share some\\nnodes but no link. Of course, node-disjoint paths, where\\ntwo paths do not have any node in common, are better and\\nreduce the risk of selective forwarding attack compared to\\nlink-disjoint paths. However, disjoint paths are not always\\navailable, and when paths are not disjoint, if the selectively\\nforwarding node is the node common to all the paths, then\\nthe attack can become as effective as in single-path routing.\\nBraided paths [120] may have nodes in common, but\\nhave no links in common (i.e., no two consecutive nodes in\\ncommon). The use of multiple braided paths may provide\\nprobabilistic protection against selective forwarding and use\\nonly localized information.\\nIn [121], Hai and Huh proposed a lightweight detection\\nalgorithm to detect selective forwarding attacks in WSNs.\\nThe proposed algorithm is based on two-hop neighbor\\nknowledge including two routing rules. The proposed al-\\ngorithm has been evaluated for WSNs and has found to be\\neffective even under high-density network conditions along\\nwith the high probability of collisions.\\nIn [122], authors describe an efﬁcient scheme for report-\\ning packet drops. They also present an effective scheme,\\nnamely “Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test”, for de-\\ntecting the selective forwarding attack in a heterogeneous\\nsensor network. According to presented simulation results,\\nproposed scheme not only achieves high detection ratio but\\nalso low false alarm rate.\\nWang et al. [123] proposed a failure detection framework\\nto detect the selective forwarding attack. The observation\\nis that for a routing node, the number of packets it for-\\nwards must be equal to the number of packets it receives.\\nIn their framework, each sensor node can work under a\\npromiscuous mode so that it can overhear the transmission\\nof neighboring nodes. If a neighbor of a suspected node\\nﬁnds that the number of packets that the suspected node\\nfails to forward exceeds a certain threshold, the neighbor\\ncan collaborate with other neighbors of the suspected node,\\nand the opinions from the neighbors of the suspected node\\nare collected to form a decision about the suspected node.\\n3.2.3.5 Defense against Sinkhole: An algorithm\\nwhich detects sinkhole attacks is presented in [124]. Pro-\\nposed algorithm ﬁrst ﬁnds a list of suspected nodes, and\\nthen effectively identiﬁes the intruder in the list through a\\nnetwork ﬂow graph.\\nIn Shaﬁei et al. ’s [125] proposal; two schemes in an\\neffort of detecting sinkhole attacks are presented. The idea\\nbehind these schemes is that the sensor nodes in the vicinity\\nof the sinkhole would deplete their energies more rapidly\\ncompared to other sensor nodes. This is due to the fact\\nthat, routes to the base station passing through sinkhole\\nare supposedly more found to be more attracting thus are\\nchosen more often. Therefore, an energy hole forms in the\\nvicinity of each and every sinkhole. The ﬁrst scheme has', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\cyber attack.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

Depending\\non the result of the estimator, base station commands all\\nnodes to bypass the doubtful area (possible attack region)\\nin their process of routing. The second scheme utilizes dis-\\ntributed monitoring methodology in order detecting areas\\nhaving less average remaining energy level.\\nZhang et al. [126] presented a scheme for detecting sink-\\nhole attacks towards WSNs based upon redundancy mech-\\nanism. In the proposed scheme; in order to detect sinkholes,\\nmessages are sent to the suspicious nodes through multi-\\npaths. By evaluating the replied messages by the suspicious\\nnodes comprehensively, the attacker nodes are conﬁrmed.\\nTeng and Zhang [127] proposed “SeRA: A secure routing\\nalgorithm against sinkhole attacks for mobile WSNs”. The\\nproposed algorithm is based on the Tiny-AODV protocol.\\nFirst, a couple of mobile-agents communicate each sensor\\nnode to gather the network connection data to construct the\\nglobal data matrix of the sensor nodes. Then, through the\\nSeRA routing algorithm, the sinkhole node can be efﬁciently\\navoided.\\n3.2.3.6 Defense against Sybil: In order detecting\\nthe Sybil-attack, two protocols are presented in [128]. The\\nﬁrst protocol employs “radio resource testing” in which\\nevery sensor node declares a unique-channel to each of\\nits neighbors. Then, it tests to see whether the neighbors\\ncommunicate with itself through the pre-declared channels.\\nHence radio circuitry of a sensor node generally cannot\\nhandle simultaneous send and receive actions on more than\\none channel, the failure at the communications through\\none channel might be an indication of the Sybil-attack. The\\nother protocol employs the “ID-based symmetric keys”. For\\ninstance, there is a global pool of keys that each sensor\\nnode has a key associated to its ID, and every node is\\npre-loaded with these keys. The ID of a suspicious sensor\\nnode is examined by witness nodes based on keys shared in\\nbetween the suspicious sensor node and the witness sensor\\nnodes.\\nIn [129], authors proposed “rule-based anomaly detec-\\ntion system (RADS)” in order monitor and detect Sybil-\\nattack towards sensor networks on time. The presented\\nmethod relied on “ultra-wideband ranging-based detection\\nalgorithm”. RADS works in a distributed fashion in which\\nevery node have the ability to trigger alarms, in case they\\nare suspicious of a node in their vicinity. The presented\\nmethod not only detects Sybil-attack in the absence of cen-\\ntral management authority or a third party trusted-network-\\nentity but also provides defending methods against the\\nadversaries by using isolation technique towards both the\\nattacker sensor node and the compromised Sybil-nodes.\\nTo defend against Sybil attacks, the identities of every\\nnode should be veriﬁed. This can be done either directly or\\nindirectly. In the direct validation, a node directly veriﬁes\\nwhether the identity of a neighboring node is valid. For\\nexample, a node may assign each of its neighbors a separate\\nchannel to communicate and ask them to transmit during\\na period. Then it checks these channels in a random order\\nwithin that period. If a node is transmitting in its assignedchannel, the node is a physical node. If no transmission is\\ndetected on a channel, it indicates that the node assigned to\\nthat channel may not be a physical node [128].\\nIn indirect validation method, another trusted node\\nprovides the veriﬁcation for the identity of a node. For\\nexample, every node may share a unique key with the base\\nstation. When two nodes need to establish a link between\\nthem, they verify each other’s identity through the base\\nstation by using these keys [59]. At the same time, they can\\nbe assigned a session key. Nodes can also be allowed to\\nestablish links with a limited number of neighboring nodes.\\nThus, compromised nodes can only communicate with a\\nlimited number of veriﬁed neighboring nodes, which also\\nlimits the impact of Sybil attacks.\\nMoreover, ID-based public keys [108] also can defeat the\\nSybil attack because both the ID and location information\\nwere taken into the generation of key material during the\\ninitialization phase, hence multiple identities need multiple\\nkeys, and this is impossible for a malicious node to achieve.\\n3.2.3.7 Defense against Wormhole: Wormholes are\\ndifﬁcult to detect because an adversary passes the packets to\\na distant point from the point at which they are received by\\nusing a single hop out-of-band channel. This channel cannot\\nbe listened to by the network. Moreover, the real copy of\\nthe packet reaches the point that receives the replayed copy\\nlater than the replayed copy. Therefore, the replayed copy is\\nfresher than the real copy.\\nDetection mechanisms against wormhole attacks can be\\nbased on temporal and spatial analysis of the packets. To\\ndetect the Wormhole attack, Hu et al. proposed to use packet\\nleashes [68], where location or timing information is em-\\nbedded in packets, to limit the maximum range over which\\npackets can be tunneled. They require that each node either\\nknows its location or has a tightly synchronized clock so\\nthat this information can be used to calculate the maximum\\ndistance that a relayed packet could travel.\\nDirectional antennas [130] were also used to defend\\nagainst the Wormhole attack, where some direction infor-\\nmation is used to detect the replayed packets. However,\\nthese defenses target ad hoc networks and require expen-\\nsive hardware devices, which may be infeasible for most\\nresource-constrained sensor networks.\\nWang and Bhargava [131] proposed to use centralized\\ncomputing to detect the Wormhole attack in sensor net-\\nworks, in which a controller collects the location information\\nfor all nodes to reconstruct the network topology such\\nthat any topological distortion can be visualized. However,\\nthe visualization approach incurs too much communication\\noverhead, especially when malicious nodes move around\\nin the entire network because each location change of the\\nWormhole triggers a new round of execution of the topology\\nreconstruction algorithm.\\nLocation-based keys [108] can effectively prevent the\\nWormhole attack because each packet is authenticated by\\nthe location-based key, which includes authentication infor-\\nmation in accordance with the position information of the\\nnodes. This method excludes the effects of wormholes by\\nattesting the position of the nodes along with their location-\\nbased keys. Attacker nodes would simply be denied to join\\nthe network if their location-based keys are invalid.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\cyber attack.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

Hence, there are not many\\nsolutions proposed in defending it against those attacks.\\nTRAIL (TRust Anchor Interconnection Loop) [134] , is\\nproposed as a generic scheme for topology authentication in\\nRPL. It detects and prevents topological inconsistencies by\\nenabling each node to validate its upward path to the root\\nand to detect rank spooﬁng on it. TRAIL also minimizes net-\\nwork message exchanges and node resource consumption.\\nHence it protects RPL against rank attack .\\nAs suggested in [75], those newly developed defense\\nsolutions need to be as simple as possible considering that\\nRPL works on low-power lossy networks. Same authors\\nsuggest integrity check for the version ﬁeld of the DIO\\nmessages to thwart DODAG version attack against RPL.\\nTo defend against RPL rank attacks, VeRA (Version\\nnumber and Rank Authentication) is proposed by Dvir et\\nal.[135]. It is a security scheme that prevents misbehaving\\nnodes manipulating their rank values for attack purposes.\\nVeRA prevents publishing an illegitimate rank value by\\ngenerating the hash chaining using random numbers chosen\\nby the root node. An attacker cannot change the rank value\\nas it requires the previous hash chain value to generate\\nthe new one. In order for a node to change its rank, rank\\nauthentication is needed. That is provided by the root node\\nconsisting of MAC (Message Authentication Code) gener-\\nated from the max rank hash value and next version number\\nas key. VeRA security scheme also prevents DODAG version\\nattack by providing veriﬁcation to version number using\\ndigital signature and MAC.\\nTo defend against RPL local repair attacks, inclusion of\\ntimer (with a long waiting time setting) to the local link\\nrepair requests might be a good solution.

On the assumption that an ad-\\nversary cannot forge authentication, the endpoints of the\\ncommunication would detect and ignore any malicious\\npackets.\\n3.2.4.2 Defense against SYN-Flooding: Connection-\\nless transport protocols are immune to SYN-Flooding at-\\ntacks, but they might not provide the necessary transport-\\nlayer functionality to applications. One way of defense\\nagainst this type of attack is SYN-cookies, which encode\\ninformation from the client’s TCP-SYN message and return\\nit to the client to avoid maintaining state at the server. How-\\never, this technique’s computational and message overhead\\nmakes it undesirable for WSNs and IoT [60].\\nAs stressed out in [57], usage of client puzzles is a\\nsolution to defend against ﬂooding attacks. The method\\npresented in [136] requires clients to demonstrate the com-\\nmitment to solve “client puzzles” in each connection. The\\nserver or base station is dedicated to create and verify puz-\\nzles for each client. The Base station has the responsibility\\nto dissipate the puzzles to the network members (nodes)\\nand whoever wishing to connect to the base station needs to\\nsolve the puzzle beforehand.\\n3.2.4.3 Defense against MQTT Exploit: Neisse et al.\\n[137] have proposed enforcement of security policy rules\\nat the MQTT layer, which can be used to support security\\nand privacy requirements. Performance results of their pre-\\nsented implementation show that enforcing complex secu-\\nrity policies introduce an additional delay of 10 ms. How-\\never, in mission-critical applications such as trafﬁc control\\nor IIoT [138], any value above 1 ms may not be tolerable\\nand can cause system failures or accidents. Therefore, in\\norder to be applicable for those scenarios, the delay related\\nperformance of the proposed scheme needs to be improved.\\nSingh et al. have proposed a Secure MQTT (SMQTT)\\nprotocol which augments security feature for the existing\\nMQTT protocol and its variants based on lightweight At-\\ntribute Based Encryption (ABE) over elliptic curves.

It is, therefore, crucial to design routing pro-\\ntocols in which these attacks are meaningless or ineffective.\\nGeographic routing protocol [77] is one class of protocol that\\nholds promise in this sense.\\nAn ultimate limitation of building a multi-hop routing\\ntopology around a ﬁxed set of base stations is that those\\nnodes within one or two hops of the base stations are\\nparticularly attractive for compromise. After a signiﬁcant\\nnumber of these nodes have been compromised, all the\\nnetwork is lost.

Any kind of algorithm\\nrunning on IoT devices needs to be designed with\\nlight-weight processing requirement.\\n•Location privacy: In the regular operation mode,\\nthings of the IoT should preserve their location pri-\\nvacy and when needed, they should provide this to\\nnetwork administrators.\\n•Self awareness: Smart objects of the IoT should\\nself-organize themselves autonomously in order to\\nfulﬁll some pre-determined speciﬁc tasks in respond-\\ning real-word environmental situations without too\\nmuch human intervention.\\n•Interoperability: In order for heterogeneous IoT de-\\nvices to communicate, collaborate and share data\\nwith each other, there should be a pre-determined\\nand standardized data exchange format.\\n4.2 Open Issues\\nThe rapid development of IoT, Industrial IoT (IIoT) and\\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has brought tremendous de-\\nmand for smart-things (sensors, equipment, and devices,\\nmostly referred as things) which are capable of sensing\\ninformation from their surrounding, processing and trans-\\nmitting it to far placed locations (mostly referred as data\\nsinks) for further analysis and conclusions. Due to this ex-\\ntreme demand, cyber-security of these IoT enabled devices\\nis somewhat disregarded [144]. Therefore, both industrially\\nand commercially used IoT devices are vulnerable to several\\nclasses of attacks and possess potential back-doors to the\\nsystems they have been attached to [145].\\nFor instance, as discussed in [146], smart home IoT-\\nenabled appliances such as power switches, thermostat\\ncontrols, smoke/ﬁre alarms, ambient lighting systems, etc.,\\nbring security concerns to the attention of the public as\\nthey allow data sniffers to observe and conclude about the\\nprivate activities of the house habitants. Apthorpe et al. [147]\\nclearly has shown that an Internet Service Provider (ISP)\\nor a network sniffer can easily infer inside activities of the\\nhouse habitants and revoke their privacy even if they are\\nemploying encryption techniques to protect the content of\\ndata they are transmitting, by simply analyzing the Internet\\ntrafﬁc pattern created by the smart home IoT devices.\\nBecause of lacking rigid security precautions and bad\\nuser habits (sometimes the IoT implementers do not bother\\nissuing a user and password for their devices, and some-\\ntimes they just continue with the default user name and\\npassword from the manufacturer), IoT devices are leveraged\\nas a workforce of the botnets by ill mannered hackers. An\\nexample of this is QBot botnet , which is also known as\\nBashlite, Gayfgt, Lizkebab and Torlus. This IoT botnet was', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\cyber attack.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

X, XX 2019\\ndiscovered in 2014 with the source code published in 2015.\\nSome variants of Qbot botnet reached over 100,000 infected\\ndevices, serving as the precursor to Mirai botnet [148].\\nMirai malware is another very good example to show the\\nweaknesses of the things of IoT. Mirai malware is devised\\nagainst Linux OS based IoT devices and gains shell access\\nof the devices to divert their operations towards the beneﬁt\\nof the Mirai botnet . The Mirai botnet then uses this kind of\\ncaptured zombie devices to perform further DDoS attacks\\nagainst more advanced targets [149]. Most probably the\\nusers of those IoT devices won’t even notice this unless\\ninspected carefully. Therefore, in order to address this chal-\\nlenge, distributed and collaborative security solutions need\\nto be optimized for IoT systems.\\nRecently revealed the Torii botnet , is a cut above both\\nthe Mirai and QBot variants, according to researchers from\\nAvast, as it possesses sophistication “a level above anything\\nwe have seen before” botnet attack has shown that security\\nof IoT needs to be considered more seriously than ever [150].\\nUnfortunately, enslavement of thousands of IoT devices\\nby botnets shows us that many IoT ecosystems do not even\\npossess basic security elements. According to an investi-\\ngation among commercial off the shelf IoT products [151],\\nthe following are deduced: On average, 25 vulnerabilities\\nare detected per device, 60% had vulnerable interfaces and\\nﬁrmware, 70% did not encrypt any communications at all,\\n80% failed to request secure length-ed password for authen-\\ntication.\\n4.3 Security Proposals\\nIoT enabled Cyber-Physical Human Systems (CPHS) are one\\nof the main components of the new era‘s cyber cities. As\\nmentioned in [152], the human is one of the key components\\nof the CPHS. For the cyber-security of CPHS, besides IoT\\nsystems, human interactions with the CPHS needs to be\\nconsidered. According to [152], 95% of all security incidents\\nhappened due to human errors. Therefore, to defeat collab-\\norative attacks against human errors, authors introduced\\nan Intrusion Tolerant System (ITS) to support IoT enabled\\nCPHS. The proposed ITS employs the Byzantine-resilient\\nstate machine approach, which combines replica diversity,\\nvoting, and cryptographic schemes to mask a number of\\ncompromised replicas of the nodes so that the CPHS can\\nresume normal operation without distortion.\\nIn [154], a privacy-preserving home automation network\\nis proposed. An encrypted overlay network is created over\\ncommercially available Virtual Private Network (VPN) ser-\\nvices to improve the privacy of the IoT users, especially the\\nones using the smart home systems.\\nIn [153], authors proposed employment of hardware-\\nbased Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), to enhance\\nand enable security-related operations to be handled at the\\nsensor level in IoT. Usage of PUFs will help in increasing\\nthe security level of the IoT, by allowing low-level secu-\\nrity implementations on the things and also by devising\\ncryptography software to perform special tasks such as\\nveriﬁcation.\\nTo enhance the security of IoT, [158] proposed remote\\nattestation for trust establishment. According to authors,\\nthis is a non-trivial task because of the complexity of the de-\\nsign regarding the trust attestation schemes. These schemes,either hardware-based (e.g. PUFs) or software-based (e.g.\\ncontrol ﬂow integrity checking), demand high power con-\\nsumption along with extra economical cost, which is not\\nsuitable for vast implementation in the IoT. Some inter-\\nmediate hybrid solutions (tailored in conjunction with the\\nrequirements and capabilities of the things) can be pro-\\nposed in the near future, by blending both hardware- and\\nsoftware-based remote attestation schemes for trust estab-\\nlishment of IoT. These hybrid solutions need to be tested\\nand veriﬁed for IoT, that they would able to work in scalable\\nconditions and under the cyber-attacks such as DoS and\\nagainst the condition of malicious veriﬁers.\\nBlock-chain technology is a newly booming technology\\nwhich was proposed for digital crypto-currencies. This tech-\\nnology was originally designed and invented by Bayer,\\nHaber and Stornetta in 1992 [159] and incorporated Merkle\\ntrees to provide the efﬁciency and reliability of the digital\\ntimestamps. As discussed in [160], F.A. Hayek published\\nhis classic book ‘Denationalization of Money’ in 1976 [161]\\nand argued that money is not different than other com-\\nmodities and needs to be supplied by competition among\\nprivate providers, not by the government. Crypto-currency\\nhas urged from that perspective, nowadays uses the block-\\nchain technology and is a very hot topic. Besides, it attracted\\nthe public attention to the block-chain technology. Many re-\\nsearchers are working to bring and provide this technology\\nfor today’s technological needs. Block-chain-based security\\nalgorithms provide a decentralized solution but involve\\nsigniﬁcant energy, delay and computational overhead which\\nis not suitable for resource constraint things of IoT. For in-\\nstance, authors of [155] have proposed usage of block-chain\\ntechnology in security and privacy of IoT. In their proposal,\\nauthors employed high processing enabled miner devices,\\nadditionally attached to the home network, to provide needs\\nand functionalities of the block-chain algorithms. However,\\nproof-of-concept applications need to be developed and\\nfurther analyzed in this manner.\\nA solution employing Software Deﬁned Networking\\n(SDN) is proposed by [156] to detect and mitigate dynamic\\nattacks against IoT. In the proposed “SoftThings” frame-\\nwork, machine learning is used at the SDN controller to\\nmonitor and learn the behavior pattern of IoT things over\\ntime. Anything out of the pre-determined behavior pattern\\nis declared as an attack. The proposed scheme would be\\nvery effective on high processing capable IoT devices such\\nas gateways and switches, but will not work on low-end IoT\\ndevices such as sensors and actuators.\\nPacheco and Hariri [157] proposed a threat model for IoT\\nto be employed for smart cyber-infrastructures which helps\\nIoT network administrators in identifying potential attacks\\nagainst each layer. The proposed threat model consists of\\nfour layers: things, network, services, and applications.\\nProviding security in IoT is challenging not only owing\\nto the limited resources of the end-devices along with lossy\\ncommunication links, but also due to the novel communi-\\ncations and networking technologies that are recently intro-\\nduced such as RPL, 6LoWPAN, TSCH, MQTT, CoAP etc.\\nImplications of using these technologies (one or many at the\\nsame time) under consideration of IoT network and device\\nlimitations need to be evaluated while taking security pre-\\ncautions.

Section III presented not only the detection\\ntechniques of attacks but also the prevention and mitigation\\ntechniques. Whereas, Section 4 speciﬁcally considered the\\ncyber-security related defense strategies devised for IoT. All\\nthese sections revealed that devising a “one-ﬁts-all” security\\nsolution to defend the WSNs and IoT against cyber-attacks\\nis non-trivial. Therefore in this section, we provide partial\\npossible candidate solutions from the literature that are\\ntargeting security of some speciﬁc features of the WSNs,\\nespecially IoT. These solutions can be categorized as follows;\\nkey distribution, trust management, data conﬁdentiality,\\nsegmented attack discovery, location privacy, hierarchical\\nintrusion detection, redundant data infusion.\\n5.1 Key Distribution\\nIn order to enhance the security of WSNs against attacks,\\none should consider increasing the effectivity and ﬂexibility\\nof the key distribution scheme being used. When using\\nencryption throughout WSNs; one of the critical issues is\\nhow to properly distribute the secret keys among sensor\\nnodes when needed. Besides, revocation of the existing\\nnodes and addition of new nodes are other challenges to\\nbe introduced while designing key management for WSNs.\\nMore interested readers would refer to [11], [90], [91], [92]\\nfor further detailed discussions regarding key distribution\\nand key management in WSNs.\\n5.2 Trust Management\\nTrust management is a very powerful concept to be used\\nin detecting misbehaving sensor nodes in WSNs. After\\none of these nodes is detected by the trust evaluation,\\nneighbors of this node can simply stop communicating\\nwith it. They can block the node by removing it from all\\nrouting tables, dropping all packets destined to/from it\\nand stopping collaborating with it. By following this idea\\nof using “trust management” to cope with attacks towards\\nWSNs, many security methodologies and protocols are pro-\\nposed in the literature. However, the proposed protocols in-\\ntroduced un-tolerable communication and/or computationoverheads and unfortunately presented limited endurance\\nagainst Sybil-attacks, DoS-attacks, and collusion-attacks. For\\ninstance, in the trust management scheme of [12], the trust\\nevaluation of sensor nodes depends on the previous behav-\\nioral pieces of evidence or the referrals from the neighboring\\nnodes. However, predicting future trust of a sensor node\\ndepending on its historical course of trust is just ignored.\\nTo enhance accuracy and efﬁcacy of trust evaluation, more\\ntrust metrics should be included, i.e. packet-loss, hop-count,\\nradio transmission range, energy consumption rate, data\\nlink latency, path-quality, etc.\\nAs mentioned above and also in [162], application of\\ntrust mechanisms seem to be the future of WSNs in order to\\nsecure the sensor network from attackers. Secure routing\\nalong with secure data aggregation techniques are being\\ndevised for WSNs, especially based upon the trust metrics\\nof the nodes. An example would be the “Trust-Aware Secure\\nRouting Framework in Wireless Sensor Networks” pre-\\nsented by Duan et al. [163], which employs the combination\\nof trust and QoS metrics in terms of routing related metrics\\nin an effort to provide an optimized and qualiﬁed routing\\nalgorithm for WSNs.\\nIn [164], Xiang et al. presented “Addition Encourage-\\nment, Multiplication Punishment (AEMP)” trust model in\\nwhich each node in the network can calculate communica-\\ntion trust values of all its neighbors. An enhanced version\\nof the AEMP trust model can be devised for WSNs in order\\nto ﬁght against the increasing number of attack scenarios.\\nSecure and efﬁcient data transmission as shown in [165]\\nwould be another solution avenue to prevent attacks against\\nWSNs. Encryption prevents eavesdropping and imperson-\\nation attacks but it brings an extra computational load to\\nthe sensor nodes, which in most cases have strict power\\nconstraints.\\nActiveTrust of [103] is also another promising security\\nsolution for WSNs, in which trusted routing is achieved\\nthrough an active detection route protocol. In ActiveTrust,\\nbasically the location and behavior of an attacker, along\\nwith the node related trust, could be gathered and utilized\\nfor avoiding blackholes while in process of real-data route\\nconstruction. This provides “blackhole” free paths for the\\nreal-data trafﬁc and improves network lifetime as well as\\nnetwork QoS drastically.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\cyber attack.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='20 TO BE APPEAR AT: IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS, VOL. XX, NO. X, XX 2019\\n5.3 Data Aggregation\\nIn WSNs, owing to the limited energy sources and com-\\nputation power, data aggregation among sensor nodes is\\nachieved at the aggregating-node and generally, this is exe-\\ncuted by using simple methodologies like as data-averaging.\\nNonetheless, data-aggregation is not robust against node-\\ncompromisation attacks. Hence not only sensor nodes are\\ngenerally deployed in unattended environments, but they\\nalso lack tamper-proof hardware; they are very vulnerable\\nto those mentioned attacks. Therefore, the inclusion of trust-\\nworthiness to data management and reputing mechanisms\\nof nodes has prime importance for sensor networks as\\nwell as IoT. Secure data aggregation techniques such as\\nIterative Filtering (this algorithm is an appealing alterna-\\ntive for sensor networks hence it solves both problems 1)\\ndata aggregation, 2) assessment of data-trustworthiness; by\\nemploying a unique iterative method [166]), would be used\\nin WSNs and IoT in order to cope with the vulnerabilities\\nmentioned above.\\nTherefore, a unique way of providing security to WSNs\\nand IoT would be “secure data aggregation”. In the speciﬁc\\napplications where average sensed data is of the interest,\\nfor example, the average temperature of a crop ﬁeld, this\\nmethod may be used efﬁciently. Data can be averaged at\\nsome “aggregation points” and these aggregation points\\nmight communicate each other in a more secure way by\\nimplementing ways of Secret Key Cryptography (SKC).\\nThis way, more attention can be paid to this speciﬁc data\\ngathering points and hence more secure data dissemination\\ncan be achieved.\\n5.4 Hierarchical Security Solution\\nAnother promising technique to cope with attacks against\\nWSNs would be hierarchical security solutions:\\nButun et al. [114]’s hierarchical IDS provides two dif-\\nferent paths of detecting intruders through watchdog and\\nmajority voting mechanisms. Multi-level cluster heads and\\nsubordinate nodes are being watched and recorded sep-\\narately, and at a speciﬁc threshold level, intruders have\\nrevoked from the network accordingly.\\nIn Wu et al. [167]’s hierarchical security framework, au-\\nthors employed dynamic adaptive chance discovery mech-\\nanism to detect unknown attacks. With this uniﬁed frame-\\nwork, low-level attack-detection is executed in sensor nodes\\nwith simple rules, and high-level attack-detection is exe-\\ncuted in sinks and at the base-station with complex rules.\\nBesides, software-deﬁned networking and network function\\nvirtualization technologies are used to perform attack miti-\\ngation when any type of attack is detected.\\n5.5 Trafﬁc Shaping\\nIndependent Link Padding (ILP) is a network trafﬁc shap-\\ning methodology proposed by Apthorpe et al. [147] in an\\neffort to protect smart home IoT systems from network\\nsnifﬁng (eavesdropping) attacks. The proposed ILP scheme\\nis promising in protecting privacies of the house habitants\\nfrom unintended eyes. ILP works in a sense to shape\\nthe trafﬁc without violating pre-determined data rate and\\nschedule of the regular network trafﬁc so that it does notcause disturbance or loss for the data communication activ-\\nities of the smart home IoT devices. In essence, the result\\nof the ILP procedure ends up with a constant ﬂow of infor-\\nmation in which regular and meaningful data packets are\\npadded with redundant data so that no useful information\\ncan be interpolated from the data trafﬁc. By this way, the\\nprivacy of the smart home users is assured against passive\\ninformation gathering (snifﬁng or eavesdropping) attack.\\nILP methodology improves the privacy of the IoT users,\\nhowever, it causes bandwidth of the network to be wasted\\nby introducing extra load and causing unnecessary trafﬁc.\\n5.6 Patch management\\nPatch management possesses a very signiﬁcant role in\\nindustrial networks and IIoT, in which timely patching\\nﬁrmware of the critical devices has prime importance, such\\nas the ones in SCADA networks, that are deployed over\\ncritical infrastructures and factories [168]. As mentioned\\nin [169], patching vulnerabilities of the IoT is also very\\nimportant as in the case of many computer networks, how-\\never, owing to their low-cost components, i.e. things of IoT\\nconsists of very cheap embedded devices most of which do\\nnot have upgradeable ﬁrmware, this is quite impossible.\\n5.7 Automated ﬁngerprinting\\nIn order to prevent node replication attacks and variants\\ntowards IoT, an automated ﬁngerprinting technique can be\\nused. In this technique, several messages emanating from\\nlegitimate devices can be characterized, such as periodic\\nstatus update messages, ﬁrmware update messages, patch\\nupdate messages, device initiation messages, etc. Any be-\\nhavior, out of this ﬁngerprint can be evaluated as a suspi-\\ncious act or an attack.\\n6 C ONCLUSION\\nThe IoT is a large-scale complex architectural design consist-\\ning of a variety of heterogeneous devices, therefore scalabil-\\nity, transparency, and reliability are most prominent issues\\nto be solved. Security-related initiatives need to consider\\nthese issues in the ﬁrst place. Besides, not only should a\\nhigher architectural security design be conceptualized, but\\nlow-level security also needs to be addressed. This can be\\nachieved by designing lightweight security protocols and\\ncryptography algorithms that are tailored according to the\\nspeciﬁc needs of the resource-constrained devices of the IoT.\\nFrom the discussions made throughout this paper, it can\\nbe deduced that the heterogeneity of the devices in IoT\\necosystem along with its scalability causes several impli-\\ncations, in terms of security. Although some of the new\\nvulnerabilities can be discovered on time, related security\\npatches cannot be installed to the end devices in a timely\\nmanner due to the mentioned IoT network implications\\nabove. Therefore IDS techniques become more important for\\nIoT systems, as some of them are even efﬁcient against zero-\\nday-attacks. If the necessary IDS techniques require high\\nprocessing power, gateway devices can be employed for this\\npurpose.\\nAs a conclusion, security must be a key component when\\ndesigning protocols for WSNs as well as IoT.
